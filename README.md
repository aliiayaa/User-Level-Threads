User-level threads

User-level threads are managed entirely by the application itself, rather than the operating system. This means that the system kernel is unaware of the individual threads and treats the entire process as a single unit.

Benefits of User-level threads:
1. No Kernel Privileges Needed
2. Application-Specific Scheduling
3. Portability
