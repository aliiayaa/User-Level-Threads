User-level threads are managed entirely by the application itself, rather than the operating system. This means that the system kernel is unaware of the individual threads and treats the entire process as a single unit.

Code Explanation:
So this code simulates user-level threads in java by using built-in level threads capabilities. Bawat user threads can run individually that can allow application na mag-run ng threads kahit walang kernel and kahit saan pa siyang operating system.

And then yung join method is sinisigurado niya na yung main threads is inaantay na matapos si user threads sa pagpoprocess niya bago niya tapusin yung execution.
